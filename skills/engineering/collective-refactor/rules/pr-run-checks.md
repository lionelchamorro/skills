## Run and honestly report the repo's checks before opening a PR

Run every check that is practical for the diff and report results truthfully. A check
that was not run must be named as such — do not imply it passed. A failing check blocks
the PR until fixed or explicitly acknowledged with a reason.

**Modern repos (ruff + mypy/pyright + pytest):**

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy src/          # or: pyright
pytest             # or: pytest tests/path/to/relevant/
```

**Legacy repos (black + isort + pylint/flake8 + pytest):**

```bash
black --check .
isort --check-only .
pylint src/        # or: flake8
pytest
```

**Important:** Makefiles here hold docker orchestration targets, not lint/test runners
(`infra-makefile-docker`). Run linters and pytest directly — do not assume `make test`
or `make lint` exists or does what it sounds like.

**Prefer (honest partial report):**

```markdown
## Checks run
- `ruff check .` — 0 errors
- `pytest tests/test_order.py` — 12/12 passed
- Full `pytest` suite: not run (requires live DB; covered in CI)
```

**Avoid:**

```markdown
## Checks
All passing ✓
# (when only one file was linted and no tests were run)
```

Narrow test runs are acceptable when broader ones need infrastructure. Name the boundary.
Never claim a check passed if it was skipped, errored out, or only partially scoped.

Reference: `py-ruff-format-modern`, `py-legacy-lint-stack`, `infra-makefile-docker`,
`pr-description` (the "how verified" section lives here).
